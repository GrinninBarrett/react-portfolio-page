## Functionality

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots/GIFs of completed application once ready -->


## Challenges

<!-- TODO: Add challenges as they arise -->


## Future Development

* I would like to turn this into a full stack application, using MongoDB and GraphQL for the backend. The purpose of this would be to have all of my projects in a database, allowing for more streamlined updating through a CMS built into the application using authentication and authorization for me to use as an admin.

<!-- TODO: Create Contact.js and add a contact form. Update links pointing to "contact" to reflect this change -->
