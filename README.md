## Future Development

* I would like to turn this into a full stack application, using MongoDB and GraphQL for the backend. The purpose of this would be to have all of my projects in a database, allowing for more streamlined updating of portfolio projects through a CMS.
* I need to either make the email form actually email me, or remove it altogether in favor of something else.
