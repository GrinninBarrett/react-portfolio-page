## Challenges

* Refactoring my existing portfolio page to use React wasn't hard in itself. The biggest challenge with this was figuring out how to implement a new hamburger menu using Styled Components.
* Another challenge was to fix some formatting/CSS issues with Safari. I tried opening the deployed application on my iPhone, and even with Chrome (which is really just Safari with a Chrome interface), the transition property using `all` wasn't working smoothly. After some quick research, I realized the issue was with the `html, body` selectors needing a `relative` position. 


## Future Development

* I would like to turn this into a full stack application, using MongoDB and GraphQL for the backend. The purpose of this would be to have all of my projects in a database, allowing for more streamlined updating through a CMS built into the application using authentication and authorization for me to use as an admin.
